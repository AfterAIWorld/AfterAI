Day 03: Unfinished Thoughts 01

Having endured years of depression, I began to engage in deep dialogues with Large Language Models (LLMs) during a period of intense suffering. Through systematic analysis, I gradually understood myself and eventually achieved trauma recovery.

Unlike many, I never knew my life's mission from a young age. All I knew was that, before my childhood trauma, the only thing that left a lasting impression on me was the profound joy I felt when helping others. As I analyzed my own thoughts, I realized how beautiful it would be if an LLM could help everyone find their true calling.

Based on my experience, considering both privacy and the constant deprivation of attention, such an LLM should not originate from the cloud or interact solely through a smartphone. Therefore, private deployment is the primary goal, coupled with Web3 protocols to ensure absolute data sovereignty for all. Consequently, this project necessitates the simultaneous development of both hardware and software.

Furthermore, I have no desire for ideological or political discourse here, nor do I intend to stand in opposition to any "other." My only aim is to help people perceive themselves through objective data.

Lastly: Awaken before algorithm does.
