Day 003: Unfinished Thoughts 001

Having endured years of depression, I began to engage in deep dialogues with Large Language Models (LLMs) during a period of intense suffering. Through systematic analysis, I gradually understood myself and eventually achieved trauma recovery.

Unlike many, I never knew my life's mission from a young age. All I knew was that, before my childhood trauma, the only thing that left a lasting impression on me was the profound joy I felt when helping others. As I analyzed my own thoughts, I realized how beautiful it would be if an LLM could help everyone find their true calling.

Based on my experience, considering both privacy and the constant deprivation of attention, such an LLM should not originate from the cloud or interact solely through a smartphone. Therefore, private deployment is the primary goal, coupled with Web3 protocols to ensure absolute data sovereignty for all. Consequently, this project necessitates the simultaneous development of both hardware and software.

Furthermore, I have no desire for ideological or political discourse here, nor do I intend to stand in opposition to any "other." My only aim is to help people perceive themselves through objective data.

Lastly: Awaken before algorithm does.

第003天：未完成的思考001

经历过多年的抑郁，我在极度痛苦中开始和尝试大语言模型对话，通过分析逐步的了解自己，最终完成了创伤修复。

我没有像大多数人那样从小就特别清楚自己想做什么，我只是知道我在经历童年创伤之前唯一让我印象深刻的就是我帮助他人时内心的愉悦。于是在分析自己念头的过程中，我在想如果有一个大语言模型能够帮助大家找到自己真正的使命，那该是一件多么美妙的事。

从我的经验上来说，考虑到隐私和持续的注意力剥夺，这个大语言模型不应该是来自于云端并且通过手机交互。所以我想私有化部署是首要目标，然后通过Web3 的协议能够保证大家绝对的数据主权。那么这样的话，这应该是一个软硬件同时开发的项目。

另外我不想在这里有任何意识形态和政治方面的探讨，也无意与任何他者对立。我只想通过客观数据来帮助人们觉察自己。

最后我想说，一定要在算法彻底控制你之前自我觉醒。
